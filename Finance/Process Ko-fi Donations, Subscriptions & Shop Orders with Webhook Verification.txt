üìù DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
Who is this for?
This workflow is tailored for content creators, artists, and developers who use Ko-fi to receive financial support through donations, subscriptions, or product sales.

Use case
This workflow automates the process of receiving and categorizing payment notifications from Ko-fi, ensuring that creators can focus on their work rather than administrative tasks. 

What this workflow does
Webhook Reception**: The workflow listens for incoming payment notifications from Ko-fi via a configured webhook.
Token Verification**: It validates incoming requests to ensure they originate from Ko-fi using a verification token for enhanced security.
Type Differentiation**: It categorizes payments into types‚Äîdonations, subscriptions, and shop orders‚Äîallowing for tailored handling for each payment type.
Custom Response Options**: Depending on the payment type received, the workflow activates specific actions or processes, enabling seamless integration with other applications or services.

Setup
Webhook Configuration:
   Access the Webhook node within the workflow and take note of your unique webhook URL. 
   Visit your Ko-fi webhooks management page at Ko-fi Webhooks Management and input this URL.

Verification Token Setup:
   In your Ko-fi account, locate the verification token in the advanced settings.
   Input this token in the Prepare node of your n8n workflow.

Enable the Workflow:
   Activate the workflow in n8n to start listening for incoming webhook notifications.

Testing:
   Use the test feature in the Ko-fi webhooks settings to send a test webhook to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

How to customize this workflow to your needs
Add Actions for Each Payment Type**: You can modify the Donation, Subscription, and Shop Order nodes to include actions such as sending emails, logging payments within a database, or triggering notifications.
  
Enhance Security Measures**: You can further refine the Check token node to include additional checks or to log all incoming webhook requests for monitoring.

Integration with Other Services**: Consider linking this workflow with messaging platforms (e.g., Slack, Discord) or CRM tools to keep your supporters informed or to manage relationships more effectively.

Custom Fields**: If needed, adjust the fields captured in the Subscription and Shop Order nodes to include more data or different parameters based on your specific use case.
