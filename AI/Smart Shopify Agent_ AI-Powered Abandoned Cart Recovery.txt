üìù DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
ü§ñ AI Cart Recovery Agent: Smart Abandoned Checkout Assistant

Transform abandoned carts into recovered sales with intelligent automation. This sophisticated n8n workflow monitors checkout abandonment, implements smart waiting periods, and sends AI-generated personalized recovery emails only when needed - maximizing conversions while respecting customer experience.

üîÑ How It Works

This intelligent 7-step recovery system recovers lost sales automatically:

Step 1: Initial Abandonment Detection
The workflow fetches current abandoned checkout data from your e-commerce platform (Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.), identifying customers who added items but didn't complete their purchase.

Step 2: Strategic Grace Period
Instead of immediately sending recovery emails, the system waits 1 hour (customizable), giving customers natural time to complete their purchase without pressure or interruption.

Step 3: Smart Re-verification
After the waiting period, the workflow rechecks the abandonment status by fetching updated checkout data, ensuring accuracy before taking action.

Step 4: Intelligent Decision Logic
Advanced conditional logic compares initial and updated abandonment lists, determining if customers are still abandoned or have completed their purchase during the grace period.

Step 5: AI-Powered Email Generation
For customers still showing abandonment, GPT generates personalized recovery emails featuring:
Customer's actual name for personal connection
Specific products left in their cart
Friendly, non-pushy messaging tone
Optional discount incentives
Compelling call-to-action to complete purchase

Step 6: Automated Email Delivery
Personalized recovery emails are sent directly to abandoned customers via Gmail or your preferred email service, maintaining professional branding and deliverability.

Step 7: Comprehensive Activity Logging
All recovery attempts are logged in Google Sheets for tracking, including customer details, email content, and campaign performance analytics.
