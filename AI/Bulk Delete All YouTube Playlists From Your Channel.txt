üìù DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
üßë‚Äçüíº Who is this for?

This workflow is for any YouTube user who wants to bulk delete all playlists from their own channel ‚Äî whether to start fresh, clean up old content, or prepare the account for a new purpose.

It‚Äôs useful for:

Creators reorganizing their channel
People transferring content to another account
Anyone who wants to avoid deleting playlists manually one by one

üß† What problem is this workflow solving?

YouTube does not offer a built-in way to delete multiple playlists at once. If you have dozens or hundreds of playlists, removing them manually is extremely time-consuming.

This workflow automates the entire deletion process in seconds, saving you hours of repetitive effort.

‚öôÔ∏è What this workflow does

Connects to your YouTube account
Fetches all playlists you‚Äôve created (excluding system playlists)
Deletes them one by one** automatically

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è This action is irreversible. Once a playlist is deleted, it cannot be recovered. Use with caution.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup

üîê Create a YouTube OAuth2 credential in n8n for your channel.
üß≠ Assign the credential to both YouTube nodes.
‚úÖ Click ‚ÄúTest workflow‚Äù to execute.

&gt; üü® By default, this workflow deletes everything. If you want to be more selective, see the customization tips below.

üß© How to customize this workflow to your needs

‚úÖ Add a confirmation flag
  Insert a Set node with a custom field like confirm_delete = true, and follow it with an IF node to prevent accidental execution.

‚úÇÔ∏è Delete only some playlists
  Add a Filter node after fetching playlists ‚Äî you can match by title, ID, or keyword (e.g. only delete playlists containing ‚Äúold‚Äù).

üõë Add a pause before deletion
  Insert a Wait or NoOp node to give you a moment to cancel before it runs.

üîÅ Adapt to scheduled cleanups
  Use a Cron trigger if you want to periodically clear temporary playlists.
