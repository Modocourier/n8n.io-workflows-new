üìù DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
Quick Setup Guide:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Import this template into your n8n instance.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure GitHub credentials for the nodes.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Connect your MCP client

THAT'S IT!
tl;dr
Supercharge your GitHub project management 
and development by integrating powerful AI capabilities directly into your n8n workflows!

This template deploys a robust SSE endpoint specifically designed for n8n's MCP client (or any MCP tool - like cursor). It unlocks a comprehensive suite of pre-configured GitHub tools, enabling your AI to act as an intelligent, automated team member.

Empower your AI to Autonomously Handle GitHub Tasks:





üß† Triage Issues: Automatically categorize, label, and assign new issues.



üßπ Combat Spam: Instantly remove unwanted issues or comments.



üìÑ Summarize Content: Condense complex Pull Requests or lengthy issue discussions for quick insights, especially for non-technical team members.



üìß Automate Reporting: Draft and send natural language email updates to management about critical, triaged issues.



And much more!

Core Capabilities at Your AI's Fingertips:

This workflow equips your AI agent with extensive GitHub control:





‚úÖ File Operations: Create, Edit, Delete, Get, and List files.



‚úÖ Issue Management: Create, Edit, Get, Comment on, and Lock/Unlock issues.



‚úÖ PR Review Oversight: Create, Get, Update, and List all reviews for a Pull Request.



‚úÖ Release Orchestration: Create, Get, Update, Delete, and List repository releases.



‚úÖ Repository Insights: Access details, issues, licenses, profiles, PRs, popular paths, and referrers.



‚úÖ User & Org Management: Get user/organization repositories; invite users to organizations.



‚úÖ GitHub Actions Control: Get, List, analyze usage, Enable/Disable, and Dispatch workflows.

Setup Guide:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Import this template into your n8n instance.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure GitHub credentials for the nodes. Best Practice: Use a dedicated GitHub account or a Personal Access Token (PAT) with minimal necessary permissions.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Connect your MCP client or AI system to the exposed SSE webhook URL (e.g., http://localhost:5678/mcp/v3805-fhrs-4afc-o5c2-389hfasfwj/sse).

‚ö†Ô∏è (Disabled by Default) Advanced API Access: Raw HTTP Request tools (GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE). Enable with extreme caution and tightly scoped credentials.

Ideal For:





Developers: Automating routine coding tasks, PR checks.



Project Managers: Streamlining issue tracking, progress reporting.



Contributors: Simplifying project interactions.



Maintainers: Reducing manual effort in triage, spam filtering, releases.



Innovators: Seeking deep AI integration with GitHub.

Drastic Time & Cost Savings ‚è≥üí∞:

Combine this template with other AI-powered n8n workflows like the Discord Message Proxy or the AI-Powered GitHub Bot to achieve significant automation of complex GitHub tasks‚Äîoften for less than the cost of a single hour of manual work!

Important Security Note on Custom API Calls: The Custom &lt;METHOD&gt; Github Request nodes are disabled by default. Their power to make any API call requires careful consideration. If you enable them, ensure the associated GitHub credentials have the absolute minimum necessary scope to prevent unintended consequences. You are responsible for their safe use.

This template is your key to unlocking intelligent automation within your GitHub ecosystem. Streamline your development processes and save valuable time today!
