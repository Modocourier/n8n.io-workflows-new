üìù DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
This workflow builds a conversational AI chatbot agent using Claude 3.7 Sonnet model with the new . It enhances standard LLM capabilities with Anthropic‚Äôs features: Web Search and Think:

Real-time web search**, to answer up-to-date factual queries.
A ‚ÄúThink‚Äù function, to support internal reasoning and memory-like behavior by Anthropic.
A memory buffer, allowing the agent to maintain conversation history.
A system prompt defining clear ethical, functional, and formatting rules for interaction.

When a user sends a message (trigger), the chatbot evaluates the query, optionally performs a web search if needed, processes the result using Claude, and responds accordingly.

‚úÖ Advantages

üß† Enhanced Reasoning Abilities**
  The Think tool allows the agent to simulate deep thought processes or contextual memory storage, improving conversational intelligence.

üåê Real-Time Knowledge via Web Search**
  The integrated web_search tool enables the agent to fetch the latest information from the internet, making it ideal for dynamic or news-driven use cases.

üßæ Contextual Responses with Memory Buffer**
  The inclusion of a memory buffer allows the agent to maintain state across messages, improving dialogue flow and continuity.

üõ°Ô∏è Built-in Ethical Guidelines**
  The system prompt enforces privacy, factual integrity, neutrality, and ethical response generation, making the agent safe for public or enterprise use.

How It Works

Chat Trigger: The workflow begins when a chat message is received via a webhook. This triggers the AI Agent to process the user's query.  
AI Agent Processing: The AI Agent analyzes the query to determine if it requires information from the website or external sources. It follows a structured approach:  
   For website-related queries, it uses the provided context.  
   For external information, it employs the web_search tool to fetch up-to-date data from the internet.  
   The Think tool is used for internal reasoning or caching thoughts without altering data.  
Language Model: The Anthropic Chat Model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) generates responses based on the analyzed query, incorporating website context or web search results.  
Memory: A simple memory buffer retains context from previous interactions to maintain continuity in conversations.  
Output: The final response is delivered to the user, excluding internal processes like web searches or reasoning steps.  

Set Up Steps

Configure Nodes:  
   Chat Trigger: Set up the webhook to receive user messages.  
   AI Agent: Define the system message and rules for handling queries.  
   Anthropic Chat Model: Select the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model and configure parameters like maxTokensToSample.  
   Memory: Initialize the memory buffer to store conversation context.  
   Tools:  
     web_search: Configure the HTTP request to the Anthropic API for web searches, including headers and authentication.  
     Think: Set up the tool for internal reasoning.  

Connect Nodes:  
   Link the Chat Trigger to the AI Agent.  
   Connect the Anthropic Chat Model, Memory, and Tools (web_search and Think) to the AI Agent.  

Credentials:  
   Ensure the Anthropic API credentials are correctly configured for both the chat model and the web_search tool.
