Upload your CRM contacts to telli and schedule AI voice-agent calls

Introduction to telli and AI Voice-Agent Calls

telli is an innovative platform that provides AI-powered voice agents capable of making calls and performing tasks tailored to specific customer use cases. These AI voice-agents can handle a wide range of communication tasks, from appointment scheduling to customer support, with remarkable efficiency and natural conversation flow.

This template is designed for businesses and organizations looking to automate their outbound calling processes using telli's AI voice-agents in conjunction with Airtable as their CRM. It solves the problem of manual call scheduling and data transfer between your CRM and calling system, saving time and reducing human error.

Prerequisites

telli account
Airtable base with contact information
n8n instance

Step-by-Step Setup Guide

n8n Setup:
   Create a new workflow in n8n.
   Add the Airtable node to connect to your CRM table.

telli API Configuration:
   Log in to your telli dashboard.
   Locate and copy your API key under telli - Settings - API/Webhooks.

Workflow Configuration:
   Add two HTTP Request nodes to your n8n workflow.
   Set the "Authorization" header in both POST requests, replacing the value with your telli API key.
   Configure the first request to use the /add-contact endpoint.
   Set up the second request to use the /schedule-call endpoint.

Data Mapping:
   Map the relevant fields from your Airtable node to the telli API requests.

Testing and Activation:
   Run a test execution of your workflow.
   Once satisfied with the results, activate the workflow.

        "fieldName": "email",
        "neededInformation": "email of the customer",

      }
    ]
  },
  "override_from_number": "string"
}

Use Cases

This template is versatile and can be applied to various scenarios, including:

Lead Qualification*: Automatically schedule calls to new leads entered in your CRM.

Appointment Reminders*: Set up calls to remind clients of upcoming appointments.

Customer Feedback*: Schedule follow-up calls after product deliveries or service completions.

Uploading Multiple Contacts

For bulk operations, you have two options:

Loop Node: Include a Loop node in your n8n workflow to process multiple contacts sequentially.

Batch Endpoints: Instead of /add-contact and /schedule-call, use telli's batch endpoints:
   /add-contacts-batch: Add multiple contacts within an array.
   /schedule-calls-batch: Schedule multiple calls at once.

Example of batch endpoint usage:
{
  "contacts": [
    {"name": "John Doe", "phone": "+1234567890"},
    {"name": "Jane Smith", "phone": "+1987654321"}
  ]
}

By leveraging this template, you can seamlessly integrate your Airtable CRM with telli's powerful AI voice-agents, automating your outbound calling process and enhancing your customer communication strategy.
