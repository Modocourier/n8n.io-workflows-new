📝 DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
This is an example of how you can make Merge by Key work.

The “Data 1” and “Data 2” nodes simply provide mock data. You can replace them with your own data sources. Then the “Convert Data” nodes are important. They make sure that the different array items are actually different items in n8n. After that, you have then the merge with the merged data.
