üìù DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
Who is this for?

Professionals, solopreneurs, or productivity enthusiasts who want to keep their Gmail inbox clean and organized without manual effort.

What problem does this solve?

Manually archiving emails clutters your time and slows you down. This workflow automates inbox cleanup by removing the "INBOX" label from messages received over 24 hours ago. A perfect companion to AI-based labeling workflows, this keeps your inbox light and relevant.

What this workflow does

Triggers every day at 4 AM
Fetches Gmail messages from the INBOX that are older than 24 hours
Processes them one by one using the Split Out node
Removes the INBOX label, effectively archiving the messages

Setup

Connect your Gmail account using OAuth2 credentials.
Customize the Schedule Trigger node to adjust the run time.
Modify the Gmail filter if you want to archive unread or labeled emails instead.

How to customize this workflow to your needs

Schedule different frequencies (e.g. twice a day or weekly).

üîÑ Pairs Well With

This complements the Intelligent Email Organization with AI-Powered Content Classification workflow.

Use that to label emails smartly using AI, and this one to auto-archive them for a clean, clutter-free inbox.
