🚀 Setup Instructions

Prerequisites
n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
Google account with Sheets access
Bright Data account with Google Shopping dataset access
Gmail account for notifications

Steps
Import the workflow JSON into n8n
Configure Bright Data credentials and dataset access
Set up Google Sheets with required columns
Configure Gmail OAuth2 credentials
Update sheet IDs and schedule settings
Test with sample products and activate

📖 Usage Guide

Google Sheet Structure
Your Google Sheet should have the following columns to ensure the workflow functions correctly:

Product URL** (Text): The direct URL to the Google Shopping product page. This is the primary identifier for the product.
Product Name** (Text): The name of the product. This will be automatically populated or updated by the workflow.
Old Price** (Number/Currency): The price of the product from the previous check. This column is crucial for price comparison.
New Price** (Number/Currency): The most recently scraped price of the product.
Ratings** (Number): The star rating of the product.
Reviews** (Number): The total number of reviews for the product.
Timestamp** (Datetime): The date and time when the price check was performed.

Adding Products
Add Google Shopping URLs to your Google Sheet.
The workflow will fetch product details and track prices.
Historical price data builds over time.

Understanding Price Alerts
The default setting for this workflow is to send an email alert when the new price equals the old price. This might seem counterintuitive, but it's useful for specific scenarios, such as:

Monitoring stable pricing:** If you are tracking a product and want to be notified when its price has remained consistent over time, indicating a potential stable buying opportunity or a benchmark.
Verifying data consistency:** To confirm that the scraping process is working correctly and consistently retrieving the same price when no changes are expected.

You can easily customize the alert logic to trigger on different conditions as described below.

Customizing Alert Logic
Price drops:** new_price &lt; old_price
Significant drops:** new_price &lt; (old_price * 0.9) (e.g., price dropped by more than 10%)
Price increases:** new_price &gt; old_price
Any change:** new_price != old_price

Reading the Results
Real-time pricing data
Historical tracking
Product metadata
Timestamps for each check

🔧 Customization Options
Add More Data:** Descriptions, availability, seller info, shipping, images
Modify Email Templates:** Customize subject and body
Multiple Recipients:** Duplicate email node and change recipients
Webhook Integration:** Add real-time triggers or Slack alerts

🚨 Troubleshooting
Bright Data connection failed:** Check API credentials and dataset access
No price data extracted:** Verify URLs and test with different products
Google Sheets permission denied:** Re-authenticate and check sharing
Emails not sending:** Re-auth Gmail OAuth and verify recipients
Filter not working:** Check price formats and logic
Workflow failed:** Check logs, retry logic, and network status

📊 Use Cases & Examples
E-commerce Monitoring:** Track competitor pricing and trends
Deal Hunting:** Get alerts for price drops on wishlist items
Inventory Management:** Monitor supplier pricing for procurement
Market Research:** Analyze pricing trends and generate reports

⚙️ Advanced Configuration
Batch Processing:** Increase batch size, add delays, use parallel processing
Price History:** Store historical data, calculate averages, forecast trends
Tool Integration:** CRM, Slack, databases, BI tools (Tableau, Power BI)

📈 Performance & Limits
Single URL:** 2–5 seconds
Concurrent Requests:** 3–5 (depends on Bright Data plan)
Data Accuracy:** 95%+
Success Rate:** 90%+
Daily Capacity:** 100–500 products
Memory:** ~100MB per execution
API Calls:** 1 Bright Data + 2 Google Sheets per product

🤝 Support & Community
n8n Forum:** &lt;https://community.n8n.io&gt;
Documentation:** &lt;https://docs.n8n.io&gt;
Bright Data Support:** Via your Bright Data dashboard
