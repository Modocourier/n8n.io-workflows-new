üìù DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
Community Node Disclaimer: As this workflow relies on a community node, it is limited to self-hosted environments.

How It Works:  

Typeform Quiz Integration: This workflow streamlines the process of handling quiz answers submitted via Typeform. It ensures the data is correctly formatted and seamlessly integrates with KlickTipp.  
Data Transformation: Input data is validated and transformed to meet KlickTipp‚Äôs API requirements, including formatting phone numbers and converting dates.

Key Features

Typeform Trigger:  
Captures new quiz submissions from Typeform, including user details and quiz responses.

Data Processing and Transformation:  
Formats phone numbers to numeric-only format with international prefixes.  
Converts dates (e.g., birthdays) to UNIX timestamps.  
Maps multiple-choice quiz answers to string values for API compatibility.  
Scales numeric quiz responses for tailored use cases.  

Subscriber Management in KlickTipp:  
Adds participants as subscribers to a designated KlickTipp list, with custom field mappings for:  
  Personal details (e.g., name, email, phone number, birthday).  
  Quiz responses (e.g., intended usage of KlickTipp, company location, and team size).
 Tags contacts for segmentation: Adds fixed and dynamic tags to contacts.  

Error Handling:  
Handles empty or malformed data gracefully, ensuring clean submissions to KlickTipp.  

Setup Instructions  

Install and Configure Nodes:  
Set up the Typeform and KlickTipp nodes in your n8n instance.

Prepare Custom Fields in KlickTipp:  
Create custom fields to store quiz answers and personal details, such as:  

  | Name                         | Datentyp    |
  |----------------------------------|-----------------|
  | Typeform_URL_Linkedin            | URL             |
  | Typeform_Frage1_klicktipp_nutzen | Zeile           |
  | Typeform_Frage2_klicktipp_sitz   | Zeile           |
  | Typeform_Frage3_mitglieder_CHT   | Dezimalzahl     |  

After creating fields, allow 10-15 minutes for them to sync. If fields don‚Äôt appear, reconnect your KlickTipp credentials.
