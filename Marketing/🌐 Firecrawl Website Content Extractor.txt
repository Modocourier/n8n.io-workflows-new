📝 DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
🌐 Firecrawl Website Content Extractor (n8n Workflow)

This n8n automation workflow uses Firecrawl API to extract structured data (e.g., quotes and authors) from web pages — such as Quotes to Scrape — and handles retries in case of delayed extraction.

🔁 Workflow Overview

🎯 Purpose:
Crawl and extract structured web data using Firecrawl
Wait for asynchronous scraping to complete
Retrieve and validate results
Support retries if content is not ready

🔧 Step-by-Step Node Breakdown

1. 🧪 Manual Trigger
Node: When clicking ‘Test workflow’
Used to manually test or execute the workflow during setup or debugging.

2. 📤 Firecrawl Extract API Request
Node: Extract
Sends a POST request to https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/extract
Payload includes:
  urls: List of pages to crawl (https://quotes.toscrape.com/*)
  prompt: "Extract all quotes and their corresponding authors from the website."
  schema: JSON schema defining expected structure (quotes[], each with text and author)

&gt; 📌 Uses an HTTP Header Auth credential for Firecrawl API

3. ⏱️ Wait for 30 Seconds
Node: 30 Secs
Gives Firecrawl time to finish processing in the background
Prevents hitting the API before results are ready

4. 📥 Get Results
Node: Get Results
Performs a GET request to the status URL using {{ $('Extract').item.json.id }} to retrieve extraction results.

5. ✅❌ Condition Check
Node: If
Checks if the data array is empty (i.e., no results yet)
If data is empty:
  Waits 10 more seconds and retries
If data is available:
  Passes data to the next step (e.g., processing or storage)

6. 🔁 Retry Delay
Node: 10 Seconds
Waits briefly before sending another GET request to Firecrawl

7. 🛠️ Edit Fields (Optional Output Formatting)
Node: Edit Fields
Placeholder to structure or format the extracted results (quotes and authors)
