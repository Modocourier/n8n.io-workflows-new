üìù DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
Overview
This n8n workflow automates the process of crawling a website's sitemap to extract URLs, which is particularly useful for SEO analysis, website auditing, or content monitoring. By leveraging n8n's nodes, the workflow fetches the sitemap from a specified URL, processes the XML data, and extracts individual URLs, which can then be converted into a downloadable file or integrated with tools like Google Sheets.

How It Works
The workflow operates in a sequential manner, utilizing a series of nodes to fetch, parse, and process sitemap data:
Trigger: Initiates when the user clicks "Test workflow" (Manual Trigger node).
Set URL: Defines the base domain (e.g., https://phu.io.vn/) for the sitemap (Set URL node).
Crawl Sitemap: Fetches the main sitemap file (sitemap.xml) from the specified domain using an HTTP request (Crawl sitemap node).
Parse XML: Converts the sitemap XML into a JSON format for easier processing (XML node).
Split Sitemap: Extracts individual sitemap entries (e.g., &lt;sitemap&gt; tags) from the parsed data (Split Out node).
Crawl Sub-Sitemap: Fetches each sub-sitemap URL listed in the main sitemap (Crawl sitemap 2 node).
Parse Sub-Sitemap XML: Converts the sub-sitemap XML into JSON (XML 2 node).
Split URLs: Extracts individual URLs (e.g., &lt;url&gt; tags) from the sub-sitemap (Split Out 2 node).
Convert to File: Saves the extracted URLs into a file for download or further use (Convert to File node).

This workflow supports both single sitemap files and sitemap indexes that reference multiple sub-sitemaps, ensuring comprehensive URL extraction.

How to Use
To implement this workflow in n8n, follow these steps:
Set Up n8n: Ensure you have an active n8n instance (Cloud, npm, or self-hosted). Refer to the n8n documentation for setup instructions.
Import Workflow: Copy the JSON from the provided Extract Website URLs from Sitemap.XML for SEO Analysis.json file and import it into your n8n instance via the workflow editor.
Configure the Domain:
   In the Set URL node, update the Domain parameter with the target website's base URL (e.g., https://example.com/).
   Alternatively, in the Crawl sitemap node, directly paste the full sitemap URL if known (e.g., https://example.com/sitemap.xml).
Test the Workflow:
   Click "Test workflow" to execute the Manual Trigger node.
   Verify that the workflow fetches the sitemap and processes the URLs correctly.
Download or Integrate:
   The Convert to File node generates a file containing the extracted URLs.
   Optionally, replace this node with a Google Sheets node to append URLs to a spreadsheet. Refer to the Google Sheets node documentation for setup.
Save and Activate: Save the workflow and activate it for production use if needed, using a trigger like a schedule or webhook (see Trigger Node).

Requirements
n8n Instance**: An active n8n instance (version 1.0 or later recommended) on n8n Cloud, npm, or self-hosted (Docker). See Choose your n8n for details.
Technical Knowledge**: Basic understanding of n8n's editor UI and node configuration. Familiarity with XML sitemaps is helpful but not mandatory.
Permissions**: For self-hosted setups, ensure the n8n process has network access to fetch the sitemap URL. For Docker deployments, verify permissions as outlined in the n8n v1.0 migration guide.
Optional**: If integrating with Google Sheets, valid Google Sheets credentials are required (see Credentials).
Timeout Configuration**: The HTTP Request nodes (Crawl sitemap and Crawl sitemap 2) have a 10-second timeout. Adjust the timeout parameter in the node settings if dealing with slow-responding servers.

FAQ
Q: What happens if the sitemap is large or contains many sub-sitemaps?  
A: The workflow handles sitemap indexes by splitting and processing each sub-sitemap individually. For very large sitemaps, ensure your n8n instance has sufficient resources (memory and CPU) to avoid performance issues. See Scaling n8n for optimization tips.

Q: Can I use this workflow with a specific sitemap URL instead of a domain?  
A: Yes, in the Crawl sitemap node, replace the url parameter ({{ $json.Domain }}sitemap.xml) with the direct sitemap URL (e.g., https://example.com/sitemap.xml). Update the node‚Äôs notes for clarity.

Q: Why am I getting a timeout error?  
A: The HTTP Request nodes have a default timeout of 10 seconds. If the target server is slow, increase the timeout value in the options parameter of the Crawl sitemap or Crawl sitemap 2 nodes.

Q: How can I save the URLs to Google Sheets instead of a file?  
A: Replace the Convert to File node with a Google Sheets node. Configure it with your Google Sheets credentials and map the loc field from the Split Out 2 node to the desired spreadsheet column. Refer to the Google Sheets node documentation.

Q: Is this workflow compatible with older n8n versions?  
A: The workflow uses nodes compatible with n8n version 1.0 and later. For older versions, check for deprecated features (e.g., MySQL support) in the n8n v1.0 migration guide.

Q: Can I automate this workflow to run periodically?  
A: Yes, replace the Manual Trigger node with a Schedule Trigger node to run the workflow at set intervals. See Trigger Nodes for configuration details.
