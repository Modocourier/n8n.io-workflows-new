üìù DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
üßë‚Äçüíº Who is this for?

This workflow is for anyone with two YouTube channels who wants to copy playlists from one to the other ‚Äî no technical skills required.

Whether you're a content creator, hobbyist, educator, or just someone managing multiple channels, this workflow helps you save time and avoid the manual work of recreating playlists video by video.

üß† What problem is this workflow solving?

YouTube doesn't provide an option to transfer or duplicate playlists between accounts or channels. That means if you want the same playlists in two places, you're stuck:

Creating new playlists manually
Searching for each video again
Copy-pasting links one by one

This workflow automates the entire process for you ‚Äî accurately, quickly, and with no manual work.

‚öôÔ∏è What this workflow does

Retrieves all playlists from a source YouTube channel (excluding private ones)
For each playlist:

  Gets all its videos
  Filters out private or unavailable videos
  Creates a new playlist in the target channel with the same title
  Adds the videos to the new playlist
Continues smoothly even if some videos fail to copy (e.g., if they‚Äôre restricted or deleted)

üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Create two YouTube OAuth2 credentials in n8n:

   One for your source channel
   One for your target channel

Assign the credentials to the correct nodes as indicated in the sticky notes:

   Source nodes ‚Üí source credentials
   Target nodes ‚Üí target credentials

Click ‚ÄúTest workflow‚Äù to run it.

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If you have many playlists or videos, you may hit YouTube‚Äôs API quota. You can request a quota increase in your Google Cloud Console if needed.

üß© How to customize this workflow to your needs

‚úÇÔ∏è Copy only specific playlists
  Use a Filter node after the playlist fetch to include only certain titles or IDs.

üìù Change the title of the copied playlists
  Modify the title in the Create playlist node (e.g., add ‚Äú(Copy)‚Äù or a prefix).

üîÑ Automate it regularly
  Replace the Manual Trigger with a Cron node if you want to run this periodically.

üß™ Test safely
  If you're unsure, use a secondary channel as your test target before applying changes to your main account.
