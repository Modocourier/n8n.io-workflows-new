üìù DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
Transform raw customer feedback into powerful testimonial quotes automatically. This intelligent n8n workflow monitors feedback forms, uses AI to identify and extract the most emotionally engaging testimonial content, and organizes everything into a searchable database for your marketing campaigns.

üîÑ How It Works

This streamlined 4-step automation turns feedback into marketing assets:

Step 1: Continuous Feedback Monitoring
The workflow monitors your Google Sheets (connected to feedback forms) every minute, instantly detecting new customer submissions and triggering the extraction process.

Step 2: Intelligent Quote Extraction
Google Gemini AI analyzes each feedback submission using specialized prompts designed to:
Identify emotionally engaging phrases and statements
Extract short, impactful testimonial quotes from longer feedback
Filter out neutral, irrelevant, or negative content
Focus on marketing-ready, quotable customer experiences
Preserve the authentic voice and emotion of the original feedback

Step 3: Automated Database Population
Extracted testimonials are automatically written back to your Google Sheets in a dedicated "Testimony" column, creating an organized, searchable database of customer quotes ready for marketing use.

Step 4: Instant Team Notification
Email alerts are sent immediately to your marketing team with each new extracted testimonial, ensuring no valuable social proof goes unnoticed or unused.

üìä Extraction Examples

Before (Raw Feedback):
"I was really struggling with managing my team's projects and keeping track of all the deadlines. Everything was scattered across different tools and I was spending way too much time just trying to figure out what everyone was working on. Since we started using your project management software about 6 months ago, it's been a complete game changer. Now I can see everything at a glance, our team communication has improved dramatically, and we're actually finishing projects ahead of schedule. The reporting features are amazing too - I can finally show my boss concrete data about our team's productivity. I honestly don't know how we managed without it. The customer support team has been fantastic as well, always quick to help when we had questions during setup."

After (AI Extracted Testimonial):
"Complete game changer - now I can see everything at a glance, our team communication has improved dramatically, and we're actually finishing projects ahead of schedule."

Healthcare Example:

Before (Raw Feedback):
"I had been dealing with chronic back pain for over 3 years and had tried everything - physical therapy, medication, different doctors. Nothing seemed to help long-term. When I found Dr. Martinez, I was honestly pretty skeptical because I'd been disappointed so many times before. But after our first consultation, I felt hopeful for the first time in years. She really listened to me and explained everything clearly. The treatment plan she developed was comprehensive but manageable. Within just 2 months, I was experiencing significant pain reduction, and now after 6 months, I'm practically pain-free. I can play with my kids again, sleep through the night, and even started hiking on weekends. Dr. Martinez didn't just treat my symptoms - she helped me get my life back."

After (AI Extracted Testimonial):
"Within just 2 months, I was experiencing significant pain reduction, and now I'm practically pain-free. Dr. Martinez didn't just treat my symptoms - she helped me get my life back."
