Q of the day: Why spending 1 hour doing a routinal staff when you could spend 1 day automating it and having fun?

PM me on [community.n8n.io](https://community.n8n.io/u/olek/summary) and let me know what do you think about this Q above.

üìù DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
How it works
This workflow will activate and deactivate a selected other workflow on schedule.

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning!
&gt; This approach won't work for trial users as it requires n8n API that is not available to trial users.
&gt; See https://docs.n8n.io/api/ for details.

Set up steps
Adjust activation/deactivation schedule per your needs. Custom (cron) interval is a recommended approach.
Set targeted Workflow ID. You will find it in the URL of the workflow you want to manage.

Set n8n API credentials:
Create an API key: how to
Create n8n credentials using the API key: how to

This workflow uses n8n node.

#DevOps #workflow-management

Other useful stuff

Need a universal Error workflow to catch both execution and trigger errors? Here you go:
Error handling: Send email via Gmail on execution or trigger-level errors

More stuff by Olek and do not forget to backup your workflows often by automating.
