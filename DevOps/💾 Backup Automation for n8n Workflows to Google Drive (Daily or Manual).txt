📝 DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
💾 Backup Automation for n8n Workflows to Google Drive – No Risk, No Stress

Hi! I’m Amanda,
I build automation workflows for n8n and Make.  
This ready-to-use workflow is designed to automatically export and back up all your n8n workflows to a designated Google Drive folder, organized by date.

It’s perfect for agencies, developers, and teams that want to protect their automation assets — without relying on manual exports or risking losing their work.

✅ What this workflow does

Fetches all your existing workflows from the n8n API  
Compiles each workflow as a .json file  
Creates a new folder in Google Drive using the current date  
Uploads each .json file to that folder  
Can be triggered manually or automatically via cron (date-time node)

⚙️ How to set it up

Connect your Google Drive in the “Folder Creation” and “Save to Drive” nodes  
Add your n8n API Key in the “Search All Workflows” and “Compiles Individual Data” nodes  
Define your time zone and execution method:
   Run manually via the “Manual Trigger” node  
   Or schedule backups using the “Date & Time” and “Schedule Trigger” nodes  
(Optional) Change the parent folder ID in the “Folder Creation in Drive” node to set your destination

Once configured, the workflow will back up your entire workflow list daily — or whenever you run it — and send the files to your Google Drive!

🧰 Nodes & Tech Used

Schedule Trigger + Manual Trigger  
Date & Time – For timestamp folder naming  
n8n API – To list and fetch each workflow  
Google Drive – Folder creation and file upload  
Merge, Move Binary Data, Set – Workflow compilation and formatting  

🧑‍💻 Who this is for

n8n developers who want peace of mind  
Agencies managing many client automations  
Anyone worried about losing their workflow work  
Teams needing version control and backup history

🛠️ Requirements

Google Drive OAuth2 credential**  
n8n API Key** (from your account settings)
