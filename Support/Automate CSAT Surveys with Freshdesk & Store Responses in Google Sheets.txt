📝 DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
Never forget to send a satisfaction survey again! This workflow helps you automatically send CSAT surveys when a Freshdesk ticket is marked “Resolved” – and logs every response in Google Sheets for easy analysis, reporting, and escalation workflows.
💡 Built for CS and ops teams who care about real feedback
This template is perfect for:
Customer Support Teams who want timely, consistent survey delivery after every resolved ticket.
Ops Leads & Admins tired of managing spreadsheets and survey tools manually.
Businesses using Freshdesk looking for a no-code feedback loop.
Automation fans who want to track, trigger, and take action — automatically.

🧩 What problem does it solve?
Manual survey processes are slow, inconsistent, and hard to scale. This automation ensures:
Fast survey delivery when experiences are still fresh.
No duplicate emails thanks to a built-in tracking system.
Centralized feedback in a Google Sheet — no more digging through platforms.
Data you can act on, like triggering Slack alerts for poor scores.

⚙️ How it works
📨 Part 1: Auto-send the survey when a ticket is resolved
Trigger: Workflow runs on a schedule (or manually via “Test”).
Pull ticket status from Freshdesk.
Compare ticket status to the last known status in Google Sheets.
Detect resolution: If status = “Resolved” (ID 4), move forward.
Update the Google Sheet to track that the survey was sent.
Fetch the customer’s email from Freshdesk.
Create & send the survey email, personalized with ticket info and your brand.
Convert Markdown → HTML for a well-formatted email.

📥 Part 2: Collect responses and store in Sheets
Form Trigger: Customer clicks the survey link and fills in the form.
Capture responses (e.g. rating + comments).
Log feedback in a second Google Sheet for analysis.


You can extend this by adding escalation steps (e.g. flagging 1–2 star ratings to managers).

🚀 Setup Instructions
🔐 Connect your tools
Freshdesk**: Add your API credentials to the get tickets and get client nodes.
Google Sheets**: Authenticate in the get existing tickets, update status, and save survey nodes.
Email (SMTP)**: Add your SMTP details in the “Send Email” node, or swap in Gmail, SendGrid, etc.

🛠 Set your data
In the Set your data node, enter:
	Your name, email, company, and position
	Your survey form link (see below)

🔗 Get the form link
Activate the workflow (toggle it ON)
Go to the “Survey” (Form Trigger) node
Copy the Production URL
Paste it into the survey link field in the Set your data node

🧾 Prepare your Google Sheets
Sheet 1: Freshdesk Tickets (status tracking)
Used by:
get existing tickets
update status


Create a new empty Google Sheet.

Add the Spreadsheet ID + Sheet Name into the nodes.

Sheet 2: Feedback freshdesk (survey responses)
Used by:
save survey to google sheet

Create a new sheet or tab. It will auto-create columns based on your survey form field labels.

Add the Spreadsheet ID + Sheet Name/GID to the save node.

🔧 Customize the workflow
📝 Survey Questions
Modify them in the Survey (Form Trigger) node.
Adjust the save survey to google sheet node as needed (or use auto-map).
💬 Email Content
Edit the subject and message in the Create the email text (Set) node.

🏷 Freshdesk Status ID
If your “Resolved” status ID isn’t 4, update the second condition in the If ticket resolved node.

📉 Escalate poor feedback
Add logic after the save survey to google sheet node:
If rating is low:
	Notify Slack
	Create a new internal ticket
	Email a team lead

🔁 Schedule Trigger
Adjust the Schedule Trigger node to your desired interval (e.g., hourly).
🔄 Use a Webhook Instead (Optional)
If Freshdesk supports ticket webhook events, swap the schedule trigger for a Webhook Trigger node to send surveys instantly on ticket resolution.
