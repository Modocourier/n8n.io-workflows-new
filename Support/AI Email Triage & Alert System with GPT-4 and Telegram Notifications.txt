❓ FAQ

Q: What kind of ROI can I expect?
A: On average, users reclaim 5–10 hours per week per inbox by eliminating low-priority noise, surfacing urgent emails instantly, and automating replies and summaries. For a business leader or agency, that’s hundreds of dollars in time savings weekly—and zero dropped balls.
