üìù DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
Community Node Disclaimer: This workflow uses community nodes and is compatible only with self-hosted n8n environments.

How It Works  

Enhanced Calendly Integration: This workflow processes bookings and cancellations in Calendly, dynamically managing invitee and guest data with KlickTipp.  

Data Transformation: Dates and times are converted into formats (UNIX timestamps) compatible with KlickTipp‚Äôs API, ensuring seamless data integration.  

Key Features  

Calendly Trigger:  
Captures new bookings or cancellations of events, including participant details.  

Invitee and Guest Subscription in KlickTipp:  
Adds or updates invitees and guests in KlickTipp based on booking details (event name, time, join link, reschedule link, cancel link, etc.).  
Tracks and processes cancellations for both invitees and guests.  
Handles rescheduling intelligently to avoid redundant operations.  

Guest-Specific Operations:  
Processes guests individually for bookings and cancellations using dynamic arrays of email addresses.  
Recovers guest data from invitee records for cancellations since Calendly does not provide guest data upon cancellation.  

Data Processing:  
Standardizes and validates input fields  
Converts phone numbers to numeric-only format with international prefixes.  
Transforms dates into UNIX timestamps.  
Reads out the name of the invitee based on both possible input fields for name (name vs. firstname and lastname field setup).  

Error Handling:  
Validates critical fields like phone numbers, URLs, and dates to prevent incorrect data submissions.  

Setup Instructions  

Authentication:  
Set up the Calendly and KlickTipp nodes in your n8n instance.  
Configure authentication for both Calendly and KlickTipp nodes.  

Custom Field Preparation in KlickTipp:  
Create the following custom fields in KlickTipp to align with workflow requirements:  

| Feld-Name                   | Feld-Typ     |
|----------------------------------|------------------|
| Calendly_event_name             | Zeile            |
| Calendly_join_url               | URL              |
| Calendly_reschedule_url         | URL              |
| Calendly_cancel_url             | URL              |
| Calendly_event_start_datetime   | Datum & Zeit     |
| Calendly_event_end_datetime     | Datum & Zeit     |
| Calendly_invitee_start_date     | Datum            |
| Calendly_invitee_end_date       | Datum            |
| Calendly_invitee_start_time     | Zeit             |
| Calendly_invitee_end_time       | Zeit             |
| Calendly_invitee_timezone       | Zeile            |
| Calendly_invitee_guests_adresses| Zeile            |  

After creating fields, allow 10-15 minutes for them to sync. If fields don‚Äôt appear, reconnect your KlickTipp credentials.  

Field Mapping and Adjustments:  
Open each KlickTipp node and map fields to match your setup. The workflow includes placeholders for:  
Invitee details (first name, last name, email, and phone).  
Event details (start/end times, timezone, etc.).  

Workflow Logic  

Trigger via Calendly event Booking:  
   A new form event booking or cancellation from Calendly initiates the workflow  

Data Transformation:  
   Processes raw Calendly event data to ensure compatibility with KlickTipp‚Äôs API.  

Add to KlickTipp Subscriber List:  
   Adds invitees and guests to the designated KlickTipp list, including event-specific details.  

Benefits  

Efficient lead generation: Contacts from event bookings are automatically imported into KlickTipp and can be used immediately, saving time and increasing the conversion rate.  
Automated processes: Experts can start workflows directly, such as reminder emails or course admissions, reducing administrative effort.  
Error-free data management: The template ensures precise data mapping, avoids manual corrections and reinforces a professional appearance.  

Testing and Deployment  

Test the workflow by triggering a Calendly event and verifying data updates in KlickTipp.  

Notes:  

Customization:  
Update field mappings within the KlickTipp nodes to align with your account setup. This ensures accurate data syncing.
