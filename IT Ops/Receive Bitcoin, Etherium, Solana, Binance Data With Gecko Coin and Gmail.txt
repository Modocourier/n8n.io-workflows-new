üìù DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
Who is this for?
This workflow is intended for Traders for trading, Crypto Investors, Professionals in Web 3, Web 3 Developers, Crypto Marketers, Web 3 Programmers, especially in the world of Crypto Currency, Blockchain, and all professionals working in the world of Web 3, including agencies or companies that use Web 3 data. Here you can read Bitcoin, Etherium, Solana and Binance data. And this is specifically for those who want and need to automate workflows involving data in Web 3 and Market Crypto, facilitating access to Web 3 and Crypto data without manual coding, improving decision-making performance for buy or sell so that it can be integrated with other tools. In fact, to read market patterns on web 3 and crypto requires precise data on Dex Market. In particular, you have to analyze and research extensively and precisely in a traditional way, which will take time. This is also a form of dedication to the community at n8n and the n8n company, as well as dedication to Traders, Investors, Web 3 Companies, Programmers, Developers, including professionals in Web 3 and Crypto so that reality no longer experiences failure and is able to answer existing reality problems.

How it works?
Easy explanation:

The First Schedule Trigger is used to position the right and wise time, and organize the get data to the next Node. It's like the right execution must be at the right time.

After that an HTTP Request will be received from Gecko Coin to work together with the Function, in this case I chose manual coding because it is detailed and specific.

After that, the Function will carry out its task, namely changing the raw data into data that is ready to be read by humans.

Then after everything is sent and received by Gmail, it produces results in the form of ready-to-read data.

You can immediately see the data thoroughly, because the data has been processed. If you want to process it again, just direct the AI ‚Äã‚Äãsystem to process it again.

And all duties and responsibilities have been completed

Very practical and easy, plus its automatic nature. I'm sure you can understand it wisely.

Set up instructions
Complete what is in the nodes as stated in the notes column.

First, you have to connect or create a Gmail ‚ÄúCredentials Account‚Äù. Because all nodes have been setup neatly and cleanly.

Second, next in Gmail, write your email address to receive the data. 

Here, just follow the module instructions that n8n has provided, making it very easy. This will honor you of course.

Everything is organized wisely, so you just follow the notes or setup instructions provided, or you can add other things according to your specific purpose and congratulations you are ready to use it.

Requirements
As a reminder:

Everything according to the conditions of your destination.
There must be (if not, make sure it is registered) in each "Credential Account" by following the guide on how to do it n8n the guide is very complete
Don't forget to save, and make sure the workflow is active.

How to customize this workflow to your needs
You can immediately add another node to save it again in the advanced node layer. Prepare the coins you want for your needs in additional nodes, so that your specific coins are also high when carrying out tasks and answering them, and according to your goals.
